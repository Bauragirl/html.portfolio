<h1>The Best Movies According to Laura</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Rocky Horror Picture Show</h3>
<p>I mean its a cult classic, and for its time it really pushed the boundries of what is and should be socially acceptable.
    Also, seeing it live with audience participation is where it's at.</p>
<h3>Edward Scissor Hands</h3>
<p>This one was a favorite of mine growing up so I've picked it for nostalgia reasons really. But Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder,
    need I say more?</p>
<h3>A man called Otto</h3>
<p>This is a more recent film I saw on Netflix. It just has everything you need to feel that tug on your heartstrings and
    just really get you thinking, it's time to live.</p>
