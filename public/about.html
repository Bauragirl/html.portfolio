<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>At a very young age I was always around a computer. My dad, who taught me that the word "nerd" was a loving term, was
  always showing me new games, Doom and Wolfenstein being the ones I remember most! Did I just age myself? Oh well.  But it
  was his passion for computers that opened me up not only to a world of gaming, but a world of technology!
</p>

<p>I remeber always being around the newest and greatest gaming consoles, pc's and gadgets. It was just how I grew up.
  I would spend days even in school in the "computer lab" to get my time in on how to navigate a apple Macintosh. When
  I got to college age I decided to take a few courses at Lindenwood University's night/evening program because I thought 
  "this is what I was meant to do." But, life happens, and well, I had to leave the program and seek out other types of 
  jobs that were not IT per say, but supporting me financially at the time. 
</p>

<p>I became the "go to" IT person at every job I had sense. Internet down? Ask Laura. Can't get the printer to connect to print? 
  Laura. Need to send an email? Laura. Can't figure out the smart board at school? Laura. Now, I am not saying I would ALWAYS have
the answers, there are only so many things myself and google can do in person, but, I was usually the first line of defense to fix 
a technical problem, and that was just a known fact wherever I worked. People just felt comfortable asking me things, the complex 
to the simple I never judged them for asking, everyone starts somewhere. I am in general a very patient person, so I can wait with 
them while they catch up.</p>

<p>I decided recently to get back into IT. I have finally found the time to sit down and really hone in on my skills 
  and figure out my wants and needs. I have been doing a bootcamp thru Udemy.com and building my "full stack" portfolio. I hope that some of these projects not only
let you see that I am motivated and eager to learn, but I am just gonna keep getting better! If you are reading this, 05/11/2023,
